# PlayFolder
Plays a folder full of files with one unified tracking bar distinguished by various colors.

In this preview image you can see the player playing Season 01 of Adventure Time with all of the episodes at the bottom as its own unique color on the tracking bar.

I added a shuffle button incase you are playing music or something with a non specific order and you don't want the same order each time.

Default order is setup to sort things the way a human would. Like episode 01 before episode 02 for example. But you can also drag the episodes along the tracker to reorder them.

I hope this will be useful to someone other than myself <3
